            <h1> WHY TO VISIT üòÅ </h1>
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p> The Sahara desert is not exactly a place that is bursting with life. However, even places that aren't can be just as fascinating. Read on to find out why. </p>
        <br> <br>
        <h2> - The beauty and tranquillity of the Sahara is unlike no other. The sight of a clear 360 degrees of the horizon is magical. </h2>
        <br>
        <h2> - The sky at night is a beautiful scene, where it isn't as hot as the daytime. Sleeping under the stars is a magical experience because of the clearness of the sky, with no trees or buildings to block the view. </h2>
        <br>
        <h2> - If you are one of those people that only visit places for food, you're in luck! In the open air, the food tastes delicious. They are organic and cooked on open fire. There are salads, fruit, and varieties of meat tossed on oil. There is pasta and different spices. If you are worried, don't. Bedouin men are great cooks.</h2>
        <br>
        <h2> - If you love adventure, a day in the Sahara is filled with excitement. It can be easy to lose your belongings, so you have to scavenge for it. You have to be Hansel and Gretel to remember your way back to camp, and hope vultures don't eat your bread crumbs. If you are scared of getting lost, the Bedouin can easily find you from their experience in the desert. Just wait where you are and you will be found. </h2>
